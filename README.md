## Installation

First, you'll need to install node.js, run "npm i" which will install all of the dependencies. This will install: node.js, express-handlebars, bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-session, mysql2, and sequelize. Then you'll type in "npm start" which will start the local server. You may have to adjust the secret and the connection.js file but it should work as coded. 

## Usage

This blog can be used as a base to expand a more in-depth blog with more features later on. An admin page or things in place to filter out certain words would be added.
